# 1. About GreenChase
 
## 1.1 About Product

GreenChase is a traceability tool for environment-friendly products developed based on blockchain technology. People can use this tool to trace whether the products they buy are environmentally friendly. It encourages users to be environmentally friendly by helping them trace and accumulate green credits, so as to improve the climate.
 
## 1.2 What’s next

As we are building the first version of the product during the GR-14 hackathon, the functions will only cover “tracing” part. In future versions, we are planning to cooperate with big brands that use recycled materials to produce their products, help them better practice sustainable development.

## 1.3 How to use grant

We will use the grant to build our team and develop the product.

## 1.4 About Team

We now just build a small team for GR-14 hackathon. We have less than 10 people from more than 5 different regions/countries with different backgrounds. We hope to keep running our project after the hackathon and publish the game in next few months.
We may build a discord after the hackathon. However, you can follow us on Twitter.
Together, we will build a great product and help make the earth a better greener place.
